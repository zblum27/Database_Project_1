Personal Health Record and Wellness Tracker:
Problem Description
Managing and tracking personal health and wellness data is currently inefficient and scattered. Individuals often struggle to consolidate their health records, wellness activities,
and goals in one secure, accessible location. This fragmentation can lead to poor health management and oversight, hindering individuals from making informed decisions about their health 
and wellness routines.
